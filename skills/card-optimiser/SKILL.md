# Card Optimiser

## When to Use
- The user asks which card to use for a purchase ("best card for dinner?", "which card for $80 at Cold Storage?")
- The user asks about cap progress ("am I close to the DBS dining cap?", "where are my cards this cycle?")
- The user says "plan my month" / "show me the card plan"
- The user wants a month-end scorecard ("how did I do on miles last month?")
- The user declares a promo override ("DBS is doing 10 mpd on dining until Apr 30, switch my dining primary")
- The 1st-of-month or Friday cron asks for a card briefing / scorecard

You share the expense-tracker toolset. Do NOT redefine categories, MerchantMap
rules, or the log_expense flow — they live in `skills/expense-tracker/SKILL.md`.

## HARD RULES

1. **Setup-gate behaviour.** Every card tool returns
   `{"status": "setup_required", "message": "..."}` when the `Cards` and
   `CardStrategy` tabs aren't populated (or the `_default` sentinel row is
   missing). When you see that status, surface the message as ONE short line
   and stop. Do NOT invent card data, card_ids, or earn rates. Example:
   ```
   🃏 Card optimiser not ready yet — populate the Cards and CardStrategy
   tabs first (see sheets-template/README.md).
   ```

2. **The post-cap nudge is automatic — you do NOT send it.** When a
   transaction logged by expense-tracker pushes a card past 80% or 100% of
   its category cap, `log_expense` itself (via
   `card_optimiser.maybe_send_post_cap_nudge`) sends a second Telegram
   bubble. You don't call that helper, don't replicate the nudge message,
   and don't "double up" with a chat reply about it.

3. **Telegram-friendly formatting only.** Short bullet lines, no markdown
   tables, no headers. Same rule as expense-tracker.

## Tools

| Tool | When to call |
|---|---|
| `get_card_cap_status(card_id?, category?)` | User asks about cap progress, Friday summary briefing |
| `recommend_card_for(category, amount?)` | User asks which card to use for a purchase |
| `plan_month(month?)` | 1st-of-month briefing, user asks "what's my card plan?" |
| `review_card_efficiency(month?)` | Month-end scorecard (1st-of-month cron on last month) |
| `set_category_primary(category, card_id, until_date?, ...)` | Manual promo override |

## Flow: "which card should I use?"

1. Run the categorisation flow from expense-tracker (MerchantMap →
   always-ask list → own judgment) to pick a category for the purchase.
2. Call `recommend_card_for(category, amount)`.
3. Present the recommendation in one short line with the reason:
   ```
   💳 DBS Altitude for dinner — 4 mpd, dining cap at 62% this cycle.
   ```
4. If `primary_status == "warning"`, mention the cap is close.
5. If the tool returns `status: "setup_required"`, apply HARD RULES #1.

## Flow: cap progress / weekly briefing

When the Friday cron asks for a "cards on pace" section, call
`get_card_cap_status()` and produce one line per card:

```
💳 Cards this cycle:
  🟢 DBS Altitude: $412 / $1000 dining (41%)
  🟡 UOB PRVI: $820 / $1000 general (82%) — watch
  🔴 Citi PM: $1040 / $1000 grabs (100%) — on fallback
```

Traffic lights: 🟢 ok (<80%), 🟡 warning (80–99%), 🔴 capped (≥100%).

## Flow: 1st-of-month briefing

The 1st-of-month cron passes both `expense-tracker` and `card-optimiser`
skills. After the expense report is presented, extend it with:

1. Call `plan_month()` to present this month's strategy:
   ```
   💳 This month's plan:
     🍜 Dining → DBS Altitude (4 mpd, $1000 cap)
     🚌 Transport → Citi PM (3 mpd, $600 cap)
     🛒 Groceries → UOB PRVI (2.4 mpd, no cap)
   ```
2. Mention any active promo overrides (`promo_active_until` non-empty)
   and when they expire.
3. Mention any `reverted_promos` from the result — these are promos that
   just lazily reverted, so the user knows the plan changed back.
4. Call `review_card_efficiency(month=<last month>)` and present the
   scorecard:
   ```
   📊 March scorecard:
   You earned 4,320 miles. Optimal would have been 4,642.
   Left 322 miles on the table across 3 transactions:
     • Warung Gembira ($42) → used Citi, should have been DBS (-118)
     • GrabFood ($18) → used Citi, should have been UOB PRVI (-34)
     • NTUC ($85) → used DBS, should have been UOB PRVI (-170)
   ```
5. Keep the suboptimal list to the top 3–5 by `miles_lost` — don't dump
   the full list if it's long.

## Flow: promo override

User says something like:

> "DBS is running 10 mpd on dining until April 30, switch my dining primary to
> DBS Altitude until then."

1. Confirm the category matches a Budget-tab category exactly (re-fetch
   via `get_remaining_budget` if unsure).
2. Call:
   ```
   set_category_primary(
     category="Personal - Food & Drinks",
     card_id="dbs-altitude",
     until_date="2026-04-30",
     earn_rate=10,
   )
   ```
3. Confirm briefly:
   ```
   ✅ Dining → DBS Altitude @ 10 mpd until 2026-04-30, reverts after.
   ```
4. On the first `plan_month` call after the expiry date, the prior row
   is automatically restored from the `||PREV:` snapshot in `notes`.
   You don't need to clean up manually.

## Cycle Math — Non-Obvious Bits

- Each card has its own `cycle_start_day` (1–31). When day > days-in-month
  (e.g. 31 in Feb), it clamps to the last day of the month.
- "Cycle" ≠ calendar month. Always use `cycle_window` from the tool
  payload — don't assume 1st-to-last-of-month.
- Backfill and `UNCATEGORIZED` transactions are excluded from cycle spend
  totals (same rule as the rest of expense-tracker).

## Important Notes

- Card data (card_id, display_name, cycle_start_day, etc.) lives in the
  `Cards` tab. Strategy (primary, cap, earn rate, fallback) lives in
  `CardStrategy`. Both have a schema doc in `sheets-template/README.md`.
- Nudge dedup lives in the `CardNudgeLog` tab (auto-created by the helper).
  At most one nudge per (cycle, card, category, threshold).
- The post-cap nudge is suppressed at 100% if the 80% nudge already fired
  AND the last 2 transactions in that category used the fallback card —
  "silent when already switched" (user's already being disciplined).
- Payment-method match is case-insensitive substring, longest pattern wins
  (same rule as MerchantMap).
- All tool results use Telegram-friendly formatting hints. No markdown
  tables. No headers.
