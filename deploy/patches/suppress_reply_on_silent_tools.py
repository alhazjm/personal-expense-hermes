"""Patch hermes-agent's run_agent.py to exit the agent loop cleanly when the
most-recent tool result included `"assistant_reply_required": false`.

Why: our log_expense tool side-channels its own Telegram confirmation bubble
via the Bot API. If the LLM then produces any final assistant reply, the
gateway sends it too — a duplicate. Prompt-level silence instructions don't
move MiniMax-M2.7.

v1 tried zeroing `final_response` at this same anchor. That was necessary
but not sufficient: the nudge/retry cascade at run_agent.py:11514+ runs
BEFORE the gateway's `if response:` gate, so zeroing alone produced ~6
user-visible warnings plus a fallback apology per expense.

v2 approach: after tool results are appended and the follow-up turn returns
empty, detect the silence flag and `break` out of the retry loop before the
nudge cascade fires. The break is modelled on the existing partial-stream
recovery break ~25 lines below this anchor — it sets `final_response`,
`_turn_exit_reason`, `self._response_was_previewed`, and breaks. Using the
same exit convention means we know this path is supported at this indent.

Applied at Docker build time. The anchor is narrow and unique. If upstream
refactors it the script exits non-zero and fails the Docker build — loud
failure, never silent breakage at deploy time. When that happens, bump
HERMES_AGENT_SHA deliberately, re-inspect run_agent.py for the new anchor,
and update this script. See CLAUDE.md "hermes-agent SHA bump checklist".
